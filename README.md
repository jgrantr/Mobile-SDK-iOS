## FFmpeg Customization

We have forked the original FFmpeg and added customized features to provide more video frame information including the frame's width and height, frame rate number, etc. These features will help to implement video hardware decoding. 

The SDK Sample Code uses code of [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org) licensed under the [LGPLv2.1](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html) and its source code can be downloaded from this [Github Page](https://github.com/dji-sdk/FFmpeg).

## Video Hardware Decoder Open Source

Please check the [VideoPreviewer](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-SDK-iOS/tree/master/Sample%20Code/VideoPreviewer/VideoPreviewer) source code for details.
